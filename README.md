# Trybe

On March 2020 I started my software development course at Trybe, in this repo I will show all my exercises and other things that I'll do during the course.

## What I've done here 

- [x] Unix & Bash
- [x] Git
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] JS
- [x] ES6

I will update this list as soon as I complete the course blocks.

So, I'm a software development student probably there is a lot of mistakes on my files, few free to send me a message.

```bash
console.log("Hello!");
```

## Thanks
