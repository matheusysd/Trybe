# Trybe

On March 2020 I started my software development course at Trybe, in this repo I will display all my exercises and other things that I'll do during the course.

## What I've display here

- [x] Unix & Bash
- [x] Git
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [ ] JS

So, I'm a software development student probably there is a lot of mistakes on my files, few free to send me a message.

```bash
console.log("Hello!");
```

## Thanks
